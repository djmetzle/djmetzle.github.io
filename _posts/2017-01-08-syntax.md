I'm having some problems with my blog's Syntax Highlighting.
For example:


```C
void main(int argc, char ** argv) { return; }
```

*should* be a validly highlighted snippet of trival C.
Let's see.

### Nope
It doesn't work.
I went [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-syntax-highlighting-on-github-pages/).
I followed the directions and added `highlighter: rouge` to my `_config.yaml` file. Perhaps that fixes it?

### Disappointment
It turns out that code-blocks aren't working quite as expected.
Fenced code blocks need to be separated into their own paragraphs to work correctly.
And my choosen theme makes inline blocks look nearly identical to the surrounding text.

### Tests
Why not try fiddling with the CSS?
There is a section in the help docs about [just that](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/).
So it says we add a file `/assets/css/style.scss` and perhaps we can edit the inline element's CSS.

### Moderate success
So inline has turned red. But that doesn't really account for "Syntax Highlighting".
That C code is a red blob now. Perhaps Adding the "C" Language hint will help?

### Not Really
But to be fair to Rouge (the Syntax Highlighter) it looks like C highlighting is just the color 555555 (a pale yellow).
Lets Try some JavaScript:

```js
function testClass() = {
	this.className = 'testClass';
}

testClass.prototype = Parent;
testClass.prototype.constructor = testClass;
```

### Ill take it!

Seems pretty legit. Maybe I could change the code color to a bright white or a light yellow.
Maybe Not.

It looks like there are some quirks with the Jekyll `kramdown`, but it all seems well enough.
