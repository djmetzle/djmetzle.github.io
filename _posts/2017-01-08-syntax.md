title: Syntax Highlighting

## Intro
I'm having some problems with my blog's Syntax Highlighting.
For example:
```
void main(int argc, char ** argv) { return; }
```
*should* be a validly highlight snippet of trival C.
Let's see.

### NOPE
It doesn't work.
I went here: [](https://help.github.com/articles/using-syntax-highlighting-on-github-pages/).
I followed the directions and added `highlighter: rouge` to my `_config.yaml` file. Perhaps that fixes it?
